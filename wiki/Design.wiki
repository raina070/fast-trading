This are the key paradigms taking into account in the Design.

To see the concrete tools and platforms, see the [ImplementationChoices Implementation Choices]

==== Process orchestration and choreography ====
  
  * *Orchestration* of a process is used to implement a certain protocol by a party. [BPEL BPEL technology] is the proposed candidate. In order to model a process, [BPMN] can be used.

  * *Choreography* concept is understood as a decentralized way of coordination of different services or processes to fulfill a certain protocol. This can be seen as a contract upon the  protocol that different actors involved have signed. WS-CDL is the proposed candidate


==== Component architecture ====
  Trading components can be designed according to [SCA Service Component Architecture].
