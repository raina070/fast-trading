This are the key paradigms taking into account in the Design.

To see the concrete tools and platforms, see the [Implementation Choices](ImplementationChoices.md)

#### Process orchestration and choreography ####

A review of technologies around "Business Process Management" can be found in http://www.ebpml.org/

  * **Orchestration** of a process is used to implement a certain protocol by a party. [BPEL technology](BPEL.md) is the proposed candidate. In order to model a process, [BPMN](BPMN.md) can be used.

  * **Choreography** concept is understood as a decentralized way of coordination of different services or processes to fulfill a certain protocol. This can be seen as a contract upon the  protocol that different actors involved have signed. WS-CDL is the proposed candidate


#### Component architecture ####
> Trading components can be designed according to [Service Component Architecture](SCA.md).
