 * A proposal performative is the expression of the intention
 * of the sender of a proposal about it. The term performative 
 * is borrowed from the FIPA terminology and the speech act 
 * theory. In this context, some examples of a sender’s intentions 
 * that can be expressed as a proposal performative are make a 
 * binding proposal, make a non-binding proposal, reject a previous
 * proposal, or accept a proposal.
